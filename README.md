# Python solution of DICE model

The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model by [William Nordhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nordhaus) is one of the mainstream Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) for evaluation of optimal climate policy. DICE models the endogenous process of the atmospheric temperature growth, which depends on the world
carbon emission and affects the world gross product via damages caused by the natural disasters. 

This Python solution solves the DICE model following the [R approach](https://github.com/olugovoy/climatedice/tree/master/R). The attached PDF file gives the reader all details about the Python approach. The code is
 well commented and gives the user different plots as solution of the DICE model. Some results are exposed in the PDF file.
